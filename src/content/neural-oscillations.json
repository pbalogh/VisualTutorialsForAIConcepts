For example, in an 8 Hz theta rhythm, large populations of neurons become more excitable and fire together roughly 8 times per second, then become less excitable, then fire together again. This creates the wave-like pattern you see on EEG - it's not neuron A triggering B triggering C in a chain, but rather thousands of neurons in a brain region pulsing together like a biological metronome."

These network dynamics create the underlying beat that coordinates when those millions of synchronized neurons fire together."
